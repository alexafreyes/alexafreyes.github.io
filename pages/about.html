        <p class="desc">I am a multimedia artist born and raised in New Jersey with a BFA in Design from Rutgers at the Mason Gross School of the Arts. I have a minor in Women's and Gender studies and integrate my studies into my work.
            <br><br>
   My work has come out of an exploration of my affinity to see from every perspective I possibly can in order to better understand where another person’s point of view comes from. MY work revolves around themes regarding the shared experiences of marginalized people and how to speak up and about the issues within them through advocacy in art. I explore interpersonal connections, the dichotomy between empathy and capitalism, and the self-image. I’m inspired by my personal relationships with institutions and analyzing them outside of my point of view, seeking to be an outsider looking in at myself to understand just how things come to be.
