            <p>(2021)</p>
            <p>Magazine concept and design</p>
            <p>The Asian body has a very limited space it is allwowed to occupy within Western media as a reault of
                tense intercontinental realtionships developed over hundreds of years in the contexts of war. Though
                Americans like to believe these harmful attitudes towards “Oriental” foreigners are a product of the
                past, it is more than obvious that these toxic sentiments linger within the modern everyday context
                of Western society.</p><p>
                (new) Club Asian aims to invite discussion and contront the long withstanding phenomenon that
                is the commodification of the Asian body in the global market. Its form draws from pornographic
                magazines that were extremely popular in the 1970s-2000s that would eventually evolve into the
                massive online porn archive, as they marked the beginning of the oversaturation of pornography in
                Western culture. Asian bodies have continually been perpetuated to be objects of White pleasure
                at the hands of Asian stereotyping avnd fetishization. Its satirical design is meant to subvert the
                expectations of a typical pornography viewer in an effort to confront one’s own shortcomings as a
                consumer of persevering colonialism and thus inspire self reflection, education, and change.</p>
